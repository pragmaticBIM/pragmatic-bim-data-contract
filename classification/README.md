Bridge files reference external IRIs by code. Full proprietary KBOB vocabularies and LCA indicator values are **not** redistributed in this repository — only row notations, concept IRIs, and mapping links. Obtain indicator values from the official KBOB ecobilans dataset. Product scheme nodes declare the mapping bridge via `dcterms:references` (see covering, separator, and window connector product vocabularies).

Local authoring may use a gitignored JSON extract under `temp/` to validate mapping notations; do not commit KBOB workbook or JSON extracts.

The same rule applies to cost standards. ICMS (copyright ICMS Coalition), eBKP-H and eBKP-T (CRB) are referenced by code only through `skos:exactMatch`, `skos:closeMatch`, `skos:broadMatch`, `skos:narrowMatch` and `skos:relatedMatch` from the open `CG-*` cost groups; no titles, definitions or reference quantities are redistributed. Licence holders resolve the codes against their own copy. Reference extracts used to verify notations live under the gitignored `temp/cost-standards/`. Edit [`scripts/cost_group_data.py`](../scripts/cost_group_data.py) and run `python scripts/generate_cost_group_vocabulary.py` instead of editing the generated TTL.

## Subsystem product classification

Envelope products (facade `FaCP-*`, roof `RCP-*`, foundation `FDP-*`) follow a **subsystem model**: assign **one parent topConcept** per element. That code drives baseline cost as a bundled installation. Internal layer narrowers (`*-INS`, `*-SUB`, `*-FIN`, and legacy suffixes such as `*-RENDER`, `*-MEM`, `*-FRAME`) are **LCA decomposition only** — not user-assignable product classifications.

| Slot | Scheme | Required? | Drives cost? | Example |
|------|--------|-----------|--------------|---------|
| `classification_code` (primary) | Envelope product | Yes | Yes — whole subsystem | `FaCP-PREFAB-MODULAR-METAL` |
| LCA layer narrowers | Same envelope scheme | No | No — carbon only | `FaCP-RENDER-ETICS-WDVS-INS` |
| `material_category` or 2nd `classifications[]` | `abstract-material-classification` | Optional | No alone | `MAT-INS-MWO` |

**Carbon patterns:**

- **Bundled** — single KBOB row on the parent (e.g. `FaCP-PREFAB-MODULAR-METAL`, pitched roof tiles).
- **Layer recipe sum** — parent + `mapping/kbob-ecobilans-layer-recipes.json` decomposes into internal layers (e.g. `FaCP-RENDER-ETICS-WDVS`, `RCP-FLAT-BITUMEN`).

**Generic internal layer roles** (new systems): `-INS` (insulation), `-SUB` (substructure/frame), `-FIN` (finish/cladding/membrane). Legacy suffixes remain unchanged.

**`MAT-INS*` usage:** tags dominant **substance**, not envelope product type. Pair with a parent subsystem code when material is known. Use alone only as an early-design fallback when the system type is not yet known — resolve to a parent product before cost sign-off. Layer `-INS` narrowers map to `MAT-INS*` via [`abstract-covering-products-to-material.mapping.ttl`](mapping/abstract-covering-products-to-material.mapping.ttl).

**Assignment decision tree:**

```
Known subsystem type (ETICS, prefab metal, bitumen flat roof, raft foundation)?
  YES → classification_code = parent FaCP-* / RCP-* / FDP-*
        cost = parent baseline entry
        carbon = direct (bundled) OR layer_recipe_sum (composite)
        optional: material_category = MAT-INS* if substance known

Only material known, no system?
  YES → material_category = MAT-INS* (early design fallback)
        resolve to parent product before cost sign-off

BIM models separate insulation layer element?
  Prefer inherit parent subsystem from assembly/context;
  do NOT assign layer notation as primary classification_code
```

Do **not** use `MAT-INS` as primary `classification_code` on boundary elements when a subsystem parent exists. Do **not** add standalone assignable insulation topConcepts (e.g. generic roof insulation) — insulation belongs under the parent subsystem or as optional material metadata.

## MEP product classification

MEP unit (`MUP-*`) and terminal (`MTP-*`) products classify generating/converting plant and end devices on `Equipment`. They align with `SystemType.unit` and `SystemType.terminal` when elements are grouped in `IfcSystem`.

| Slot | Scheme | Required? | Example |
|------|--------|-----------|---------|
| `classifications[].classification_code` | `AbstractMepUnitProduct` or `AbstractMepTerminalProduct` | When product type is known | `MUP-VENT-AHU` |
| `equipment_type` | PBS enum | Yes (IFC-derived) | `hvac`, `electrical`, `plumbing`, `fire_safety`, `controls` |
| Parent `System.system_type` | PBS enum | When grouped in `IfcSystem` | `unit` vs `terminal` |
| Parent system functional context | Via system assignment | Validates discipline | ventilation system → `MUP-VENT-*` / `MTP-VENT-*` |

**Validation rule (documented, not enforced in schema yet):** the discipline token in `MUP-*` / `MTP-*` notation must be compatible with the parent system's `ConnectionFunctionalType` (via [`mep-product-to-connection-functional-type.mapping.ttl`](mapping/mep-product-to-connection-functional-type.mapping.ttl)). `MTP-FIRE-*` cross-cutting terminals are exempt — discipline is inherited from the inline host system.

**Notation:** `{PREFIX}-{DISC}-{PRODUCT}` where `PREFIX` is `MUP` or `MTP`, and `DISC` is `ELEC`, `DATA`, `VENT`, `HEAT`, `COOL`, `FW`, `WW`, `SM`, or `FIRE` (terminals only, cross-cutting).

IFC ingestion hints: [`mep-product-to-ifc-class.mapping.ttl`](mapping/mep-product-to-ifc-class.mapping.ttl).

## Room name notation (v2)

Building space name classification uses a three-level numeric code (similar to D0165 / Uniclass):

| Level | Pattern | Example | Assignable on `IfcSpace` |
|-------|---------|---------|--------------------------|
| Category | `RN-{CC}` | `RN-03` Circulation | No |
| Subgroup | `RN-{CC}-{GG}` | `RN-03-10` Horizontal circulation | No |
| Leaf | `RN-{CC}-{GG}-{LL}` | `RN-03-10-01` Corridor | Yes (`SpaceNameType`) |

- Source of truth: [`scripts/room_name_data.py`](../scripts/room_name_data.py)
- Regenerate SKOS, enum, and mappings: `python scripts/generate_room_name_vocabulary.py`
- v1 mnemonic codes (`RN-CIR-COR`, …) map to v2 via [`mapping/room-name-notation-v1-to-v2.mapping.ttl`](mapping/room-name-notation-v1-to-v2.mapping.ttl)
- Concept IRIs (`RN_CIR_COR`, …) are stable; only notation and enum keys changed

## Published documentation

Human-readable reference docs are generated from the SKOS and mapping TTL files:

- **Live site:** [schema.pragmaticbim.ch/classification](https://schema.pragmaticbim.ch/classification/)
- **Regenerate locally:** `python scripts/build_classification_docs.py` (or `python scripts/build_site.py` for schema + classifications)
- **Catalog:** [`catalog.yaml`](catalog.yaml) lists vocabularies and mappings included in the docs

Abstract product **unit prices** are a separate cost enrichment layer keyed by SKOS product notation from the vocabularies above. That layer (LinkML module, price data, and reference cost model) is unpublished working material and lives outside the contract under `temp/cost/`.

CI validates that committed `site/.md-src/classification/` matches the TTL sources (`schema-generation.yml`).
