<!-- no inheritance hierarchy -->





## Applicable Classes

| Name | Description | Modifies Slot |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Entity](Entity.md) | Common base class for everything in the project graph. Has identity, lifecycle, and status. |  yes  |
| [Agent](Agent.md) | Abstract base class for human and software actors in workflow and communication roles. |  yes  |
| [Person](Person.md) | Individual stakeholder, contributor, assignee, or responsible party represented in the schema. Instances may contain personal data; privacy slots govern lawful processing, consent, retention, and redaction. |  no  |
| [Company](Company.md) | Organization, company, or legal entity participating in the project or asset lifecycle. |  no  |
| [SoftwareAgent](SoftwareAgent.md) | Automated actor (integration, bot, or pipeline) acting in workflow roles. |  no  |
| [Decision](Decision.md) | Decision entity for workflow traceability and governance. Entity.status covers lifecycle; decision_status uses workflow vocabulary URIs. |  yes  |
| [Task](Task.md) | Task entity for implementation and follow-up workflows. Entity.status covers lifecycle; task_status uses action status vocabulary URIs. Links to related entities via applies_to_entities. |  yes  |
| [Process](Process.md) | Running BPMN process instance in the project graph. Use process_definition_uri for the BPMN definition key or artifact. When orchestration state lives in an external engine, set external_instance_uri to that system of record. |  yes  |
| [Message](Message.md) | Message entity for coordination and traceability. Links to related entities via applies_to_entities. |  yes  |
| [Artifact](Artifact.md) | External project artifact (text document, model, or plan) at storage_link. Used for provenance (Requirement.source_artifact). Not a modeled building element. |  yes  |
| [Contract](Contract.md) | Commercial agreement entity for project scope, parties, and governance. Links to a signed artifact and related model entities via applies_to_entities. Entity.status covers record lifecycle; contract_status uses workflow vocabulary URIs. |  yes  |
| [Project](Project.md) | Business delivery scope for spatial context, systems, and workflow entities. |  yes  |
| [Program](Program.md) | Portfolio or capital program scope grouping related projects. |  yes  |
| [Product](Product.md) | Commercial product or service offering sold by a company. |  yes  |
| [Deliverable](Deliverable.md) | Outcome or handover item produced within a project. |  yes  |
| [Requirement](Requirement.md) | Prescriptive requirement entity (content_kind requirement). Applies to model entities via applies_to_entities. Domain is discriminated by concrete subclass (PerformanceRequirement, SpatialRequirement, DeliverableRequirement, etc.), not a separate slot. |  yes  |
| [PerformanceRequirement](PerformanceRequirement.md) | Performance target requirement (U-value, fire rating, airflow, acoustic, etc.). Boolean targets use target_value_boolean with requirement_property_key aligned to entity slot names where applicable (for example is_heated on Space). Application pipelines compare the subject entity slot to the requirement target and record the outcome as MatchChange (match_status met, unmet, or unknown). |  no  |
| [SpatialRequirement](SpatialRequirement.md) | Spatial constraint requirement (min area, min height, adjacency, etc.). |  no  |
| [RegulatoryRequirement](RegulatoryRequirement.md) | Regulatory reference requirement (building code, norm, standard). |  no  |
| [BriefRequirement](BriefRequirement.md) | Client or programme requirement, including free-standing brief items. |  no  |
| [DeliverableRequirement](DeliverableRequirement.md) | Deliverable or documentation requirement (model LOD, O&M manual, export format, etc.). |  no  |
| [ScheduleRequirement](ScheduleRequirement.md) | Schedule obligation requirement (deadline, milestone, or start/finish window). |  no  |
| [CostRequirement](CostRequirement.md) | Cost or budget requirement (unit-cost cap, total budget limit, etc.). |  no  |
| [MaterialRequirement](MaterialRequirement.md) | Material or product specification requirement for matching against assigned materials. |  no  |
| [PhysicalElement](PhysicalElement.md) | Base class for physical elements that can be placed in built asset/level context. |  yes  |
| [Separator](Separator.md) | Abstract base class for elements that separate spaces or zones. |  no  |
| [SeparatorWall](SeparatorWall.md) | Wall-based separating element. |  no  |
| [SeparatorSlab](SeparatorSlab.md) | Slab-based separating element (for example floor/roof/base slab separators). |  no  |
| [ConnectionPhysical](ConnectionPhysical.md) | Physical connector providing functional connection between spaces (for example door, window, duct, pipe, cable). |  no  |
| [Boundary](Boundary.md) | Physical element acting as a boundary treatment (for example covering). |  no  |
| [Equipment](Equipment.md) | Endpoint or device element (for example terminal, unit, control device, sensor) located in a space and assigned to a system. |  no  |
| [VirtualEntity](VirtualEntity.md) | Abstract base class for non-physical, conceptual, or informational entities. |  yes  |
| [SpatialContext](SpatialContext.md) | Context node used to represent perimeter, legal site, built asset, level, or zone. |  yes  |
| [PerimeterContext](PerimeterContext.md) | Spatial context node constrained to perimeter semantics. |  no  |
| [LegalSiteContext](LegalSiteContext.md) | Spatial context node constrained to legal site semantics. |  no  |
| [BuiltAssetContext](BuiltAssetContext.md) | Abstract spatial context for built assets such as buildings and civil structures. |  no  |
| [BuildingContext](BuildingContext.md) | Spatial context node constrained to building semantics. |  no  |
| [CivilStructureContext](CivilStructureContext.md) | Spatial context node constrained to civil structure semantics. |  no  |
| [LevelContext](LevelContext.md) | Spatial context node constrained to level/storey semantics. |  no  |
| [ZoneContext](ZoneContext.md) | Spatial context node constrained to zone semantics. |  no  |
| [Space](Space.md) | Spatial container used for occupancy, circulation, service, or analysis. |  no  |
| [System](System.md) | Building service system grouping that serves spaces or zones. |  no  |
| [ConnectionVirtual](ConnectionVirtual.md) | Logical or topological connection between spaces and/or physical elements. |  no  |
| [TimeRecord](TimeRecord.md) | Planned work record with baseline and actual dates, optionally linked to model entities and a time plan. — Set milestone_at to mark as a zero-duration checkpoint. — Populate component_time_items to act as a plan container. |  no  |
| [CostRecord](CostRecord.md) | Cost record for estimation, catalog pricing, and calculation. Use cost_record_role to distinguish catalog cost/price (on Product) from project estimate/actual lines. Populate component_cost_items to act as an assembly (aggregated unit price). |  no  |
| [Material](Material.md) | Material definition that can be associated with one or more entities. |  no  |
